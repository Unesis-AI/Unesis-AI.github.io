**With over <span style="color:gold;">30 million</span> forcibly displaced people in Africa and <span style="color:gold;">2,000 languages</span> spoken across the continent, language barriers significantly hinder healthcare access and diagnostic accuracy.**

Our solution focuses on two key areas:

### 1. Audio Translation During Medical Check-ups  

We provide real-time audio translation during medical consultations to bridge language barriers, ensuring clear communication between healthcare providers and patients, no matter their background.

### 2. Accelerating Diagnosis with AI-Powered Medical Imaging  

Using machine learning and advanced imagery analysis, we aim to speed up the diagnosis process, offering quicker and more accurate insights into patients' conditions.

### Our Vision  
Our vision is to create an inclusive healthcare system where technology supports underserved populations, providing timely and accessible medical care. By focusing on refugee and displaced communities, we hope to make a lasting impact on the lives of millions.
